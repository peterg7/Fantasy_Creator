About
=====

This is an application intended to be used for the creation of fantasy stories.
There is a family tree component, a timeline, a map builder, and a list view
overview. All of these aspects are interconnected and allow the user to create
a world within the computer.

Usage
=====

Simply run `python fantasycreator.py` from within the 
project folder.

- The Family Tree tab allows the user to easily create/delete characters
   and build both blood and romantic relationships.
- The Timeline tab allows the user to visualize the timing of created 
   characters. It also provides means to create events within time.
- The Map Builder tab enables the user to edit uploaded images or create
   maps from scratch. The locations created on the map are integrated with
   the Timeline events.
- The Character Scroll tab is meant to visualize the intersection of the 
   previous three tabs. Basic information, created events, and known 
   locations can all be seen in this view. It also contains a text editor
   for adding character notes
