# BUG HUNTER!

This document is meant as a way to track currently unresolved bugs that are discovered by a user interacting with the application. It's not the cleanest method for debugging but it's quite useful given the size of the app and there only being one developer. There is also a [Jira tracker](https://petergish.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/FC/boards/1) that provides a more organized and thorough bug tracking system.
